# GigaDong Documentation

## üçÜ Welcome to GigaDong

The ultimate on-chain dick measuring contest on Sei Network. Grow your PP, collect dongles, and earn $SCHLONG tokens in the most provocative crypto game ever created.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is GigaDong?

GigaDong is a crypto mining simulator where size literally matters. Players purchase and upgrade their "PP" (production facilities), equip "dongles" (mining equipment), and earn $SCHLONG tokens based on their share of the network's total "cum rate" (mining power).

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   - Visit [gigadong.xyz](https://gigadong.xyz)
   - Connect your MetaMask or compatible wallet
   - Ensure you're on Sei Network (Chain ID: 1329)
   - Have at least 100 SEI for initial setup

2. **Get Your First PP**
   - Pay 69 SEI to receive your "tiny pp" (Tier 1)
   - Receive a free "Sheer Willpower" dongle automatically
   - Start earning $SCHLONG immediately!

3. **Grow Your PP**
   - Use earned $SCHLONG + SEI to upgrade through 11 tiers
   - Each tier unlocks more slots and juice capacity
   - Higher tiers provide cum rate bonuses (up to 50%)

4. **Collect Dongles**
   - Purchase blind boxes with $SCHLONG + SEI
   - Equip dongles to boost your cum rate
   - Complete sets for massive bonuses (up to 100%)

5. **Manage Your Juice**
   - Your PP requires juice to operate
   - Dongles consume juice over time
   - Recharge when needed to keep earning

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### PP (Production Platform) System

Your PP is your base of operations. Each wallet can own exactly one PP, which determines your earning capacity.

#### PP Tiers

| Tier | Name | Slots | Max Juice | Upgrade Cost | SEI Fee | Cum Rate Bonus |
|------|------|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | tiny pp | 1 | 2,000 | Free (Initial) | 69 | 0% |
| 2 | smol pp | 2 | 5,000 | 100 $SCHLONG | 5 | 0% |
| 3 | slightly smol pp | 4 | 8,000 | 500 $SCHLONG | 10 | 0% |
| 4 | medium pp | 6 | 15,000 | 2,000 $SCHLONG | 25 | 0% |
| 5 | almost big pp | 10 | 30,000 | 6,250 $SCHLONG | 50 | 0% |
| 6 | big pp | 12 | 50,000 | 15,000 $SCHLONG | 100 | 0% |
| 7 | thicc pp | 16 | 100,000 | 25,000 $SCHLONG | 200 | 0% |
| 8 | chad pp | 20 | 200,000 | 45,000 $SCHLONG | 400 | 15% |
| 9 | giga chad pp | 24 | 400,000 | 75,000 $SCHLONG | 800 | 25% |
| 10 | ultra chad pp | 30 | 1,000,000 | 125,000 $SCHLONG | 1,600 | 35% |
| 11 | infinity pp | 50 | 2,500,000 | 200,000 $SCHLONG | 3,200 | 50% |

#### Upgrade Cooldowns

Each PP upgrade has a cooldown period:
- Tier 1‚Üí2: 10 minutes
- Tier 2‚Üí3: 30 minutes
- Tier 3‚Üí4: 1 hour
- Tier 4‚Üí5: 3 hours
- Tier 5‚Üí6: 6 hours
- Tier 6‚Üí7: 12 hours
- Tier 7‚Üí8: 24 hours
- Tier 8‚Üí9: 48 hours
- Tier 9‚Üí10: 5 days
- Tier 10‚Üí11: 10 days

üí° **Pro Tip**: You can reduce cooldowns by 50% using Express Service (costs additional SEI).

### Juice System

Juice is your PP's energy source. Without juice, your PP stops producing $SCHLONG.

#### How Juice Works

- **Capacity**: Based on PP tier + dongle bonuses
- **Drain**: Each equipped dongle consumes juice per block
- **Regeneration**: Some utility dongles provide juice regen
- **Net Drain**: Total drain - regen = depletion rate

#### Recharge Options

| Option | Juice Amount | $SCHLONG Cost | SEI Cost |
|--------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| Wee Boost | 800 | 50 | 0.25 |
| Tiny Boost | 2,000 | 100 | 0.5 |
| Smol Boost | 5,000 | 200 | 1 |
| Medium Boost | 15,000 | 500 | 2 |
| Big Boost | 50,000 | 1,000 | 4 |
| Thicc Boost | 100,000 | 1,800 | 8 |
| Chad Boost | 200,000 | 3,500 | 16 |
| Giga Boost | 400,000 | 6,000 | 32 |
| Ultra Boost | 1,000,000 | 10,000 | 64 |
| Infinity Boost | 2,500,000 | 20,000 | 128 |

## üé∞ Dongles & Collections

### What Are Dongles?

Dongles are NFT mining equipment that boost your PP's earning power. Each dongle has unique stats and can be equipped to available slots on your PP.

### Dongle Properties

Every dongle has both mining and utility properties:

**Mining Stats:**
- **Shots/block**: Direct cum rate contribution
- **Juice/block**: Energy consumption rate

**Utility Stats:**
- **Juice Bonus %**: Increases PP's max juice capacity
- **Juice Regen %**: Regenerates juice per block
- **Drain Reduction %**: Reduces total juice consumption
- **Cum Rate Bonus %**: Multiplies all cum rates

### Blind Box System

Dongles are obtained through blind boxes - you won't know which item you'll get until after purchase!

- **Fixed price per collection**
- **1% chance for secret rare items (3x stats)**
- **Limited supplies create scarcity**
- **EOA only (no bots allowed)**
