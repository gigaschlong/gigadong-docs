## 🍆 Welcome to GigaDong

GigaDong is the ultimate on-chain crypto mining simulator where **size literally matters**. Grow your PP, collect powerful dongles, and earn deflationary **$SCHLONG** tokens on **Sei Network**.

### What makes GigaDong special?

- **Provocative Gameplay** – a tongue-in-cheek competition to flex the biggest PP on-chain.
- **Unified NFT Dongles** – every dongle has both mining *and* utility stats.
- **Aggressive Burns** – 72-90 % of spent $SCHLONG is burned, driving constant buy pressure.
- **Sustainable SEI Fees** – multiple fee touch-points create steady team revenue without dumping tokens.
- **3-Tier Referral System** – earn when friends (and their friends) ape in.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Buy a PP** – pay 69 SEI to mint a *tiny pp* and receive a free soul-bound dongle.
2. **Equip Dongles** – open blind boxes with $SCHLONG + SEI to get mining gear and utility upgrades.
3. **Earn $SCHLONG** – emissions are distributed every block based on your share of the network cum rate.
4. **Manage Juice** – dongles consume juice; recharge with $SCHLONG + SEI to keep mining.
5. **Upgrade Your PP** – spend $SCHLONG + SEI to climb 11 tiers from *tiny* to *infinity* for more slots & bonuses.
