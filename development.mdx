## üîß Smart Contract Stack

| Contract | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **GigaDongMain** | Owns PP data, juice tracking, reward distribution, SEI fee handling (upgradeable proxy). |
| **DongleNFT (ERC-721)** | Mintable NFTs representing dongles with unified mining + utility stats. |
| **BlindBox** | Handles blind-box sales, randomness, and NFT minting. |
| **Marketplace** | Built-in P2P trading with escrow, 10 % $SCHLONG fee + 2 SEI listing fee. |
| **$SCHLONG (ERC-20)** | Fixed-supply token (69 M) with burn function. |

All contracts are written in Solidity ‚â•0.8.21 and deployed on **Sei EVM** under upgradeable proxies for future flexibility.

### Key Mechanics Implemented On-Chain

1. **Per-block Reward Distribution** ‚Äì Manual gas-efficient update on user interactions; rewards = `(cumRate / totalCumRate) * emissionRate`.
2. **Juice Depletion & Recharge** ‚Äì Net drain = `grossDrain √ó (1 ‚Äì drainReduction) ‚Äì juiceRegen`. When juice hits 0 the PP stops earning.
3. **Unified Dongle Stats** ‚Äì Each NFT stores both mining stats (shots/block, drain) *and* utility stats (bonuses) in a single struct.
4. **Three-Tier Referrals** ‚Äì 10 % / 5 % / 3 % revenue shares encoded to prevent circular references.
5. **Whitelist Discounts** ‚Äì Admin-set percentage off for PP mint or specific blind-box collections.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Audits

- Reentrancy guards on all payable functions.
- EOA-only modifier for blind-box purchase to block bots.
- Access control (`Ownable + Timelock`) on admin functions.
- Professional audit scheduled before main-net launch.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Frontend Locally

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/gigadong/core.git
cd core

# Install deps & run
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dApp runs at `http://localhost:3000` and connects to Sei test-net by default.
