## 🏪 Marketplace

### NFT Trading Basics

- Peer-to-peer trading built directly into the dApp.
- **10 %** seller fee in $SCHLONG (burn mechanics still apply).
- **2 SEI** listing fee paid upfront.
- Supports buy & sell orders with advanced filters (collection, rarity, stats).

### Listing a Dongle

1. Open **Marketplace → List**.
2. Select the dongle from your inventory.
3. Set price in **$SCHLONG** (minimum 1 $SCHLONG).
4. Pay 2 SEI listing fee and sign transaction.
5. Item appears in order book instantly.

### Buying

- Sort or filter to find desired dongle.
- Click **Buy**, confirm the $SCHLONG payment.
- NFT is transferred to your wallet; funds distributed (burn / team / referral).

### Trading Tips

- **Secret rares** (1 % drop) usually trade for **3-5×** box price.
- Completing a set often yields higher ROI than stacking raw cum-rate.
- Early-collection dongles become scarce over time → speculative premium.

> Flip responsibly. Remember that 72-90 % of $SCHLONG spent gets burned, reducing circulating supply.
