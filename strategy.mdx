## ðŸŽ¯ Game Strategy

### Early Game (Tiny â†’ Medium PP)

1. **Cheap dongles first** â€“ Classic / Playful Condoms offer best cum-rate per SEI.
2. **Chase 2-3 piece set bonuses** (+10-30 % cum rate).
3. **Watch juice** â€“ Donâ€™t equip more drain than you can afford to recharge.
4. **Upgrade PP wisely** â€“ More slots = more earning; time cooldowns overnight.

### Mid Game (Big â†’ Chad PP)

1. **Utility Dongles** â€“ Stamina Reservoirs (+juice) and Performance Enhancers (-drain) extend uptime.
2. **Full sets** â€“ 5-piece bonus doubles your cum rate.
3. **Flip duplicates** â€“ Sell extras on the marketplace to fund upgrades.
4. **Cooldown Express** â€“ Use SEI to halve long waits strategically.

### Late Game (Giga Chad â†’ Infinity)

1. **Quality over quantity** â€“ High-tier dongles out-perform low-tier fillers.
2. **Stack utility effects** â€“ Regen + Drain Reduction = 24/7 uptime.
3. **Hunt secret rares** â€“ 3Ã— stats push you up the leaderboard.
4. **Leverage PP bonus** â€“ Infinity PP grants +50 % global cum-rate.
