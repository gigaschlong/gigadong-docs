## ðŸ”§ Technical Overview

### Smart Contract Stack

| Contract | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **GigaDongMain** | PP data, juice tracking, reward distribution (upgradeable). |
| **DongleNFT** | ERC-721 with both mining & utility stats. |
| **BlindBox** | Random box sales + minting. |
| **Marketplace** | P2P order book, escrow, fee handling. |
| **$SCHLONG** | Fixed-supply ERC-20 with burn. |

All contracts are written in **Solidity â‰¥0.8.21** and deployed on **Sei EVM**.

### Key Mechanics

1. **Per-block rewards** â€“ Calculated lazily on user actions.
2. **Juice depletion / recharge** â€“ Net drain formula on-chain.
3. **Three-tier referrals** â€“ Prevents circular reference.
4. **Whitelist discounts** â€“ Per address & collection.

### Security

- Reentrancy guards (`nonReentrant`).
- EOA-only modifier for BlindBox.
- `Ownable` + Timelock for admin.
- Professional audit before main-net.

### Developer Resources

```bash
# Clone frontend
pnpm create gigadong
cd gigadong
pnpm dev
```

Contract addresses will be published post-deployment.
