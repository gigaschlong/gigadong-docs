## 🚀 Getting Started

### What is GigaDong?

GigaDong is a crypto mining simulator where **size literally matters**. Players purchase and upgrade their “PP”, equip NFT “dongles,” and earn deflationary **\$SCHLONG** tokens based on their share of the network’s total **cum rate** (mining power).

2. **Mint Your First PP**
   - Pay **69 SEI** to mint a **tiny pp** (Tier 1)

3. **Grow Your PP**
   - Spend earned **\$SCHLONG \+ SEI** to upgrade through 11 tiers

   - Higher tiers grant up to **\+50 % cum-rate bonus**
4. **Collect Dongles**
