## **Executive Summary: GigaDong \- The On-Chain Dick Measuring Contest**

### **What is GigaDong?**

GigaDong is an on-chain crypto mining simulator on Sei Network where players grow their "pp" (facilities) and equip "dongles" (miners) to earn $SCHLONG tokens. It's essentially a dick-measuring contest with real crypto rewards.

### **How It Works**

1. **Start Your Journey**  
     
   * Pay 69 SEI to get your first "tiny pp" (tier 1\)  
   * Receive free "Sheer Willpower" dongle (soulbound)  
   * Start earning $SCHLONG immediately

   

2. **Grow Your PP**  
     
   * Use $SCHLONG \+ SEI to upgrade through 11 pp tiers (tiny → infinity)  
   * Each pp tier has more slots and juice capacity  
   * Dynamic cooldown between upgrades

   

3. **Collect Dongles**  
     
   * Buy blind boxes with $SCHLONG \+ SEI  
   * Get random dongles: condoms, pills, toys  
   * Each dongle has both mining stats (Shots/block, Juice drain) and utility stats (bonuses)  
   * Complete sets for up to 100% bonus

   

4. **Earn $SCHLONG**  
     
   * Emissions distributed every block (\~0.5s)  
   * Your share \= (Your Cum Rate / Total Network Cum Rate) × Current Emission  
   * Initial: 2 $SCHLONG/block (\~350,000/day), halves every \~10 days

### **Tokenomics**

**$SCHLONG Token**

* Fixed Supply: 69,000,000  
* 85% for mining rewards  
* 15% for initial liquidity (10,350,000)  
* Ultra-fair launch (no team tokens)

**Revenue Model**

* Initial PP: 69 SEI flat fee  
* PP Upgrades: $SCHLONG \+ SEI fees (5-3,200 SEI based on tier)  
* Primary dongle sales: 10 SEI \+ 10% $SCHLONG to team  
* Recharge fees: $SCHLONG \+ SEI fees (1-20 SEI based on size)  
* Premium features: Various SEI fees for customization and express services  
* 72-90% of $SCHLONG burned (after fees & referrals)  
* Secondary NFT trades: 10% fee \+ 2 SEI listing fee  
* Creates constant buy pressure \+ sustainable SEI revenue

### **PP Progression**

| Tier | PP Size | Slots | Max Juice | $SCHLONG Cost | SEI Fee | Cum Rate Bonus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | tiny pp | 1 | 2,000 | Free | 69 | 0% |
| 2 | smol pp | 2 | 5,000 | 100 | 5 | 0% |
| 3 | slightly smol pp | 4 | 8,000 | 500 | 10 | 0% |
| 4 | medium pp | 6 | 15,000 | 2,000 | 25 | 0% |
| 5 | almost big pp | 10 | 30,000 | 6,250 | 50 | 0% |
| 6 | big pp | 12 | 50,000 | 15,000 | 100 | 0% |
| 7 | thicc pp | 16 | 100,000 | 25,000 | 200 | 0% |
| 8 | chad pp | 20 | 200,000 | 45,000 | 400 | 15% |
| 9 | giga chad pp | 24 | 400,000 | 75,000 | 800 | 25% |
| 10 | ultra chad pp | 30 | 1,000,000 | 125,000 | 1,600 | 35% |
| 11 | infinity pp | 50 | 2,500,000 | 200,000 | 3,200 | 50% |

*Note: Juice capacity depletes based on equipped dongles' juice/block drain and must be recharged*

### **Dongle System**

**Unified Dongle Properties:**

* Every dongle has both mining and utility stats  
* Mining stats: Shots/block (cum rate) and Juice/block drain  
* Utility stats: Juice Bonus %, Juice Regen %, Drain Reduction %, Cum Rate Bonus %  
* Mining-focused dongles have base utility values (no bonuses)  
* Utility-focused dongles have zero mining values but powerful bonuses

**Collections Released:**

* 19 total collections (15 mining \+ 4 utility)  
* 5 items per collection (4 regular \+ 1 secret)  
* Blind box mechanic with set pricing per collection  
* Limited supplies: 10,000 (early) → 69 (legendary)  
* Examples: Classic/Playful Condoms, Pills, Toys, Crypto Legends, Utility Collections

**Set Bonuses (Cum Rate only):**

* 2 items: \+10%  
* 3 items: \+30%  
* 4 items: \+60%  
* 5 items: \+100%

### **Whitelist System**

**PP Whitelist:**

* Discounts on initial PP purchase (0-100% off)  
* Set per address by admin  
* Applied to both SEI and SCHLONG costs

**Blind Box Whitelist:**

* Per-collection discounts (0-100% off)  
* Limited quantity per address per collection  
* Applied to both SCHLONG and SEI costs

### **Viral Mechanics**

1. **Referral System:** 3-tier (10%-5%-3%)  
2. **Leaderboard:** Public pp size rankings  
3. **Meme-Ready:** Provocative theme designed to spread  
4. **Collection FOMO:** Limited blind boxes per collection  
5. **Emission Boosts:** 2x rewards during special events

### **Why It Works**

* **Simple Core Loop:** Buy pp → Get dongles → Earn $SCHLONG → Manage juice → Upgrade  
* **Sustainable Burns:** 72-90% of spent tokens destroyed \+ juice recharges  
* **Balanced Engagement:** Juice management requires periodic interaction  
* **Social Proof:** On-chain dick measuring contest  
* **NFT Trading:** Secondary market for rare dongles with strategic value  
* **Viral Design:** Shock humor drives organic growth  
* **Economic Viability:** PP costs adjusted for realistic progression at various FDVs  
* **Supply Scarcity:** Limited boxes (10K → 69\) create FOMO and value  
* **Multiple Strategies:** Mining-focused vs efficiency builds vs utility stacking  
* **Sustainable Revenue:** Multiple SEI fee touchpoints ensure long-term viability

### **Launch Strategy**

**Pre-Launch:** Build hype with dong memes **Day 1:** KOL outreach → Public launch **Ongoing:** New collection every few days, premium features

### **The Bottom Line**

GigaDong gamifies the crypto degen experience into an absurd competition where size literally matters. It's BigCoin.tech meets meme culture \- a sustainable ponzi that embraces what it is while creating genuine entertainment value.

```

### **Economic Sustainability Model**

**Token Flow Analysis:**

* Total Supply: 69,000,000 $SCHLONG  
* PP Upgrades Total: \~583,100 (0.85% of supply)  
* Max Collection Demand: \~30.5M tokens (0.44x supply)  
* Combined Maximum: \~31.1M (0.45x supply)  
* Burn Rate: 72-90% of purchases  
* Result: Highly sustainable with burn mechanics

**SEI Revenue Projections:**

* Month 1: \~830,000 SEI ($166,000)  
* Steady State: \~370,000 SEI/month ($74,000/month)  
* Primary drivers: Recharge fees (48%), PP upgrades (45%), Premium features (7%)

**Price Sustainability at Different Market Caps:**

| FDV | Token Price | Entry Box Cost | Mid Box Cost | Late Box Cost |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| $1M | $0.0145 | $0.73 | $8.70 | $72.50 |
| $3M | $0.0435 | $2.18 | $26.10 | $217.50 |
| $10M | $0.145 | $7.25 | $87 | $725 |
| $20M | $0.290 | $14.50 | $174 | $1,450 |

**Why This Works:**

1. Entry remains accessible even at 20x from launch  
2. Limited supplies create scarcity and FOMO  
3. Not everyone will buy every box (realistic: 50-70% sell rate)  
4. Burn mechanics remove 72-90% from circulation  
5. PP upgrade costs reasonable at 0.85% of supply  
6. Juice system creates ongoing sinks  
7. Multiple SEI revenue streams ensure sustainability without $SCHLONG dumping

### **Mobile Responsive Design**

Portrait Mode shows simplified vertical layout:

* PP display at top (smaller)  
* Stats below  
* Action buttons stacked  
* Swipe between sections

### **Social Sharing "PP Card" Concept**

## **1\. Introduction / Overview**

GigaDong is an on-chain cryptocurrency mining simulator built on Sei Network, inspired by successful projects like BigCoin.tech and JeetDonalds.fun. The game combines DeFi mechanics with NFT collection elements in a provocative, meme-focused package designed for viral growth.

**Core Concept:** Players purchase "pp" and "dongles" to maximize cum rate, earning $SCHLONG token emissions proportional to their share of the network's total cum rate. The project embraces shock humor and meme culture while maintaining sustainable tokenomics.

**Key Differentiators:**

* NFT-based dongles with blind box mechanics and collection bonuses  
* Unified dongle system where every dongle has both mining and utility properties  
* Multi-tiered referral system  
* Aggressive deflationary mechanics through burns  
* Controversy-baiting theme designed for viral spread  
* Juice management system requiring active engagement  
* Dual revenue model with both $SCHLONG and SEI fees for sustainability  
* Comprehensive whitelist system for both PP and blind box purchases

### **13.4 Utility Effects Explained**

* **Juice Bonus %:** Multiplicatively increases your pp's maximum juice  
* **Juice Regen %:** Restores X% of max capacity per block (offsets drain)  
* **Drain Reduction %:** Reduces total juice/block drain from all equipped dongles (max 90% total reduction)  
* **Cum Rate Bonus %:** Multiplicatively increases cum rates from all mining dongles

Example calculation:

* Base PP capacity: 50,000 juice  
* With 10% Juice Bonus: 50,000 × 1.1 \= 55,000 juice  
* With 0.05% Juice Regen: 55,000 × 0.0005 \= 27.5 juice/block restored  
* With 5% Drain Reduction on 1.0 juice/block drain: 1.0 × 0.95 \= 0.95 juice/block  
* Net drain: 0.95 \- 0.0275 \= 0.9225 juice/block
